title: 'Authentication'

All API endpoints are authenticated using your secret key. You can generate a secret key in the [API section of your settings screen](https://app.loanscape.io/dashboard/settings/api) on Loanscape.

Pass your secret key in the `Authorization` header to all requests to the Loanscape API.

Keep your secret key safe. You should generate a new secret key if you believe your key may have been compromised - this will expire your existing key.
