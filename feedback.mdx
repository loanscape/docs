title: 'Feedback'

Thanks for your interest in the Loanscape API, an exciting project that we're currently working on.

We're open to general ideas and suggestions, and have also listed some questions in particular for which we're collecting feedback.

### General

1. Are there any use cases not covered by the current reference - for example, you'd like to perform a full sync periodically and return full data for *all applications* with one endpoint?
2. Can we improve the format of the data returned (or the format of the endpoints and parameters themselves)?

### List applications

3. Are there any other core fields that would be useful in the **List applications** endpoint, for example status or broker company name?

### Fetch application data

4. Should we make it possible to retrieve members of the broker's team, as part of the **Fetch application data** endpoint or a new endpoint?
5. For `tag`, should we also return the color indicated for the tag?
6. `nextDocumentDueDate` indicates the next date that a document is due. We could also look for the next date that a yearly document is due, which would be a good indication of the yearly renewal date. (However, there may be documents with yearly renewals on different dates.)
7. Are there any fields that aren't relevant or required, for example `assignedUsers` or `contractProcessors`?
8. Are there any fields or data that may be needed in addition to what is specified - for example, the `role` of `assignedAccountExecutive` or `assignedUsers`?
9. Instead of passing all fields by default, should we allow parameters to be passed to the API endpoint to specify which fields should be returned?
