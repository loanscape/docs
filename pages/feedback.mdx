title: 'Feedback'

Thanks for your interest in the Loanscape API, an exciting project that we're currently working on.

We're open to general ideas and suggestions, and have also listed some questions in particular for which we're collecting feedback.

### General

1. Should we add further webhooks or webhook functionality, for example passing application data within webhook events themselves?
2. Are there any use cases not covered by the current reference - for example, you'd like to perform a full sync periodically and return full data for *all applications* with one endpoint?
3. Can we improve the format of the data returned (or the format of the endpoints and parameters themselves)?

### Fetch application data

4. For `tag`, should we also return the color indicated for the tag?
5. Are there any fields that aren't relevant or required, for example `assignedUsers` or `contractProcessors`, or the `userId` of users?
6. Are there any fields or data that may be needed in addition to what is specified - for example, the `role` of `assignedAccountExecutive` or `assignedUsers`?
