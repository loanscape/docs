Webhooks are POST requests we send to an URL that you specify, to notify you of new or updated applications. After your server recieves a webhook event, you can pass the `applicationId` to our [Fetch application data](/api-reference/endpoint/get_application) endpoint to fetch the latest data for that application.

You can set up webhooks in the [Developers section of your settings screen](https://app.loanscape.io/dashboard/settings/developers) on Loanscape.

**Webhook URL**: this is the URL that we will send POST requests to when an application is created or updated.

**Webhook secret (optional)**: This will be passed in the `webhook-secret` header of the POST requests. When processing requests from Loanscape, you should verify that the value matches. This verifies that the webhook is really being sent by Loanscape.

<Info>
  The webhook secret is unrelated to your API token - these can (and should) be different values.
