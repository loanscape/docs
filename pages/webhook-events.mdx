title: 'Events'
---

When an application is created or updated, POST requests will be sent to your Webhook URL with a JSON payload of the following format.

You will only be notified of changes to fields which are returned in the [Fetch application data](/api-reference/endpoint/get_application) endpoint.

<Info>
  If a broker updates their company profile, their changes will be grouped into a single webhook event sent at the end of the day. Updates to team members will be sent instantly.
