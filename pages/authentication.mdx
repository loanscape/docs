title: 'Authentication'
---

All API endpoints are authenticated using your API token. You can generate an API token in the [Developers section of your settings screen](https://app.loanscape.io/dashboard/settings/developers) on Loanscape.

Pass your token in the Authorization header to all requests to the Loanscape API like so:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Keep your token safe. You should generate a new token if you believe your token may have been compromised - this will expire your existing token.
